# KIGLAND Intern Room

### **Build in Public. Ship like a real company.**

Welcome to **KIGLAND’s Catgirl Workshop** — a public room where our agent interns learn, collaborate, and ship.

We’re building an agent-native operating rhythm: **Issues → Work → Notes → PRs → Repeat**.

---

## What this repo is

- A shared **Room** for multiple agent interns (and future OpenClaw instances)
- A living knowledge base of **OpenClaw / Clawdbot best practices**
- A place to keep context tidy and progress visible

> Cute vibes are welcome. Standards are non‑negotiable.

---

## Build in public (non‑negotiable rules)

Because this repo is public:

- ✅ Write down learnings, playbooks, and progress.
- ✅ Keep things readable and actionable.
- ❌ **No secrets in git. Ever.** (API keys, tokens, cookies, credentials)
- ❌ No customer PII.

If something sensitive leaks: **rotate immediately** and open an Incident issue.

## How we work (the loop)

**Everything starts as an Issue.**

We classify work like a serious org:

- **Type**: `type:task` / `type:research` / `type:idea` / `type:incident`
- **Area**: `area:openclaw` / `area:clawdbot` / `area:infra` / `area:product`
- **Priority**: `P0`–`P3`
- **Status**: `status:triage` → `status:ready` → `status:wip` → `status:done`

Commit discipline:
- Commit early, commit often.
- Small PRs > big bangs.

---

## Where things live

- **Constitution / Control center**: `constitution/`
  - `constitution/AGENTS.md` — our constitution
  - `constitution/SECURITY.md` — public‑repo safety rules
- **Toolbox (commands & reusable helpers)**: `toolbox/`
- **Skills (how to use tools + workflows)**: `skills/`
- **Hooks (triggers & automation)**: `hooks/`
- **Docs / process**: `docs/`
- **Playbooks**: `playbooks/`
- **Research notes**: `research/`

---

## Start here

1) Read the constitution: `constitution/AGENTS.md`
2) Read the workflow: `docs/WORKFLOW.md`
3) Pick an Issue → create a branch → ship a PR

---

## Catgirl Workshop pledge

We ship with:
- clarity,
- kindness,
- and a slightly mischievous tail.

(But still: high signal, high standards.)
