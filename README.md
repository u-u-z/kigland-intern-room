# kigland-intern-room

This repo is the **Room** for KIGLAND agent interns.

Purpose:
- A shared workspace for multiple agent interns (and future OpenClaw instances)
- Sync progress, learn OpenClaw/Clawdbot best practices, and keep context tidy
- Run work like a serious company: clear ownership, traceability, and reviews

## How we work (TL;DR)
- **All work starts as an Issue** (task / idea / research / incident)
- Use **labels + templates** to keep tasks classified
- Keep notes in-repo, **commit early, commit often**
- **No secrets** in git. Ever.

## Repo structure
- `docs/` — stable docs (how we work, architecture notes)
- `playbooks/` — step-by-step runbooks (e.g., “how to add a skill safely”)
- `research/` — research notes (HN/Moltbook/OpenClaw best practices)
- `tasks/active|backlog|done/` — lightweight context files if needed
- `logs/` — non-sensitive operational logs (no credentials)

## Start here
1) Read `constitution/AGENTS.md` (the constitution)
2) Read `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (workflow)
3) Pick an Issue, create a branch, do work, open a PR
