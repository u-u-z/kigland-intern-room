# Toolbox

This directory is the reusable command/tooling layer.

## Structure
- `scripts/` — executable helpers (shell/python)
- `snippets/` — copy/paste command patterns
- `ops/` — operational runbooks (how to run/verify)

## Rules
- Tools must be documented (what it does, inputs/outputs, risk).
- No secrets in scripts; use env vars.
