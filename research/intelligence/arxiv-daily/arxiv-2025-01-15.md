## 📄 Papers

### 1. [Grounding Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Controlled High-Quality Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09194v2)

**Authors:** Ahmad Süleyman, Göksel Biricik
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI
**Published:** 2025-01-15
**Relevance Score:** 10.8 | **Areas:** ai, vision
**PDF:** [Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09194v2)

**Abstract:** Text-to-image (T2I) generative diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding performance in synthesizing diverse, high-quality visuals from text captions. Several layout-to-image models have been developed to control the generation process by utilizing a wide range of layouts, such as segmentati...

### 2. [Unified Few-shot Crack Segmentation and its Precise 3D Automatic Measurement in Concrete Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09203v1)

**Authors:** Pengru Deng, Jiapeng Yao, Chun Li et al.
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.RO
**Published:** 2025-01-15
**Relevance Score:** 8.4 | **Areas:** ai, vision
**PDF:** [Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09203v1)

**Abstract:** Visual-Spatial Systems has become increasingly essential in concrete crack inspection. However, existing methods often lacks adaptability to diverse scenarios, exhibits limited robustness in image-based approaches, and struggles with curved or complex geometries. To address these limitations, an ...

### 3. [Guiding Retrieval using LLM-based Listwise Rankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09186v1)

**Authors:** Mandeep Rathee, Sean MacAvaney, Avishek Anand
**Categories:** cs.IR, cs.AI
**Published:** 2025-01-15
**Relevance Score:** 6.0 | **Areas:** ai
**PDF:** [Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09186v1)

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong promise as rerankers, especially in ``listwise'' settings where an LLM is prompted to rerank several search results at once. However, this ``cascading'' retrieve-and-rerank approach is limited by the bounded recall problem: relevant documents not ret...

### 4. [Patch-aware Vector Quantized Codebook Learning for Unsupervised Visual Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09187v1)

**Authors:** Qisen Cheng, Shuhui Qu, Janghwan Lee
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG
**Published:** 2025-01-15
**Relevance Score:** 4.8 | **Areas:** manufacturing
**PDF:** [Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09187v1)

**Abstract:** Unsupervised visual defect detection is critical in industrial applications, requiring a representation space that captures normal data features while detecting deviations. Achieving a balance between expressiveness and compactness is challenging; an overly expressive space risks inefficiency and...

### 5. [A Coordination-based Approach for Focused Learning in Knowledge-Based Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10394v1)

**Authors:** Abhishek Sharma
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL
**Published:** 2025-01-15
**Relevance Score:** 1.2 | **Areas:** ai
**PDF:** [Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10394v1)

**Abstract:** Recent progress in Learning by Reading and Machine Reading systems has significantly increased the capacity of knowledge-based systems to learn new facts. In this work, we discuss the problem of selecting a set of learning requests for these knowledge-based systems which would lead to maximum Q/A...

### 6. [Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192v3)

**Authors:** Aditya Deole, Mehran Mesbahi
**Categories:** math.OC, cs.RO, eess.SY
**Published:** 2025-01-15
**Relevance Score:** 1.2 | **Areas:** ai
**PDF:** [Download](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09192v3)

**Abstract:** In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributio...
