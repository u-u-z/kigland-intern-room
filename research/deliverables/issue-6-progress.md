## Issue Recommendation

**Current State**: All strategic research complete. Implementation track waiting for decision.

**Options**:
1. **Close Issue** - Research phase complete, create new issues for implementation
2. **Keep Open** - Convert to tracking issue for ongoing technology monitoring
3. **Restructure** - Split into implementation issue (#13) and strategic tracking issue

**Recommended**: Close this issue (strategic research complete) and:
- Use #13 for Kigurumi manufacturing implementation
- Create new issues for specific strategic initiatives as approved
